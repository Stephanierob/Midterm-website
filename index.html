        <h1>The Design Process</h1>
        <p>
             We choose our characters, a women and a men. We cut them out in a piece of paper then we traced their shape in cardboard so the paper wouldn't fold and stand straight. After all the characters where doen we decided to move to headings and add 4 little headings to explain what was happening in that section of the animation. We then cut out a cardboard that would be the stage and would hide all the motors and just show the characters and headings. After we where done with the setup of the stage we moved on to how the characters wouold move to show the story, we used motors glued to the characters and heading and we made a code that would allowe them to hide under the stage and when commanded to they would come up and show the story, once done with their story they would go down again as well as the headings.
