        <h1>Generating Ideas</h1>
        <p>
            We had to comne up with a story that would show the reproduction rights and how they affect the woman. We choose to do teenaage pregnacy and SA that would all connect to abortion which in some states now its ilegal and we wanted to show how they really affect a large part of the female population because sometimes its not their choice to have that pregnancy or to continue with it but they have no other choice and now they have to have the baby.

        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <p>
             We choose our characters, a women and a men. We cut them out in a piece of paper then we traced their shape in cardboard so the paper wouldn't fold and stand straight. After all the characters where done we decided to move to headings and add 4 little headings to explain what was happening in that section of the animation. We then cut out a cardboard that would be the stage and would hide all the motors and just show the characters and headings. After we where done with the setup of the stage we moved on to how the characters would move to show the story, we used motors glued to the characters and heading and we made a code that would allowe them to hide under the stage and when commanded to they would come up and show the story, once done with their story they would go down again as well as the headings.
